						<p>
							Technical analysis aims at forecasting the price movement of stocks or any other tradable instrument that is usually subjected to the forces of demand and supply. These trading instruments can include stocks, futures, bonds, currency pairs, etc. 
							<br/><br/>
							The technical analysis takes mainly three factors into consideration while forecasting the price movement â€” Price, Volume, and Moving Averages. With the help of these factors, you can determine the direction in which your stock or fund is prevailing. 
							<br/><br/>
							Now the question is, how technical analysis is used? 
							<br/>
							To support technical analysis trading, various researchers and trading experts have developed hundreds of signals and patterns across the industry. Besides, there are various software and tools like stock screens that are capable of forecasting the price movement by using various technical indicators.
